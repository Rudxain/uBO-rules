# Contribution Guidelines
Contrib to `{user|admin}.*` is welcome. `{user|admin}.*` is "community-focused", despite being designed for my family, and my friends.

Contrib to `rx.*` is allowed, but only if I like it (case-by-case basis, at my discretion). Before contrib to `rx.*`, you should be **very confident** that the edits are likely to be desirable by me. If unsure, open an issue asking about it
